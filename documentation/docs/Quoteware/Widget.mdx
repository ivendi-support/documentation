The Finance Comparator is an embeddable widget that can be easily integrated with a full page advert on your website. The widget acts as the gateway to a fully compliant finance suite; providing customers with a finance calculator and range of finance products to suit their needs, an easy to use application form, and a secure account to save their applications for later use.

:::note

Only one comparator widget may be present on the page at any one time.

:::

## Getting Started
* Review the fields and values required to power the Finance Comparator
* Try out the widget in the live editor
* Embed the widget using our embed code - available in HTML, PHP & WordPress and Python
