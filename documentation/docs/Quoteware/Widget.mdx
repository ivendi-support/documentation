:::note

Only one comparator widget may be present on the page at any one time.

## Getting Started
* Review the fields and values required to power the Finance Comparator

* Embed the widget using our embed code - available in HTML, PHP & WordPress and Python

## Demo
:::tip LCV & VAT

For vehicles classed as LCV the finance calculators can be adjusted to show the VAT. This can be done by setting the following two parameters accordingly VATqualifying=true and VATincluded=false whilst ensuring class=LCV. When the parameters are set correctly the customer can control whether they want to pay the VAT as the deposit by using the toggle.
