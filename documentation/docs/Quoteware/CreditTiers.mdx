Both [Quoteware](../GettingStartedQuoteware.md) and [Payment Search](./PaymentSearch.mdx) have a field available called `CreditTiers`.
This field is used if the dealer is set up to have Risk Based Pricing (RBP).
Using this field, you can request just the specific tier of credit that you would like in your response. This can be handy, if for example you want to show the cheapest quote,
as this will always be the lowest credit tier. You can also use this to match up the quotes from the [Calculator](../Quoteware/Widget.mdx) if they have credit tiers enabled.
