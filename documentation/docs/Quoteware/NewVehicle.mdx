The documentation thus far has had a focus on quoting for used vehicles. However, it is possible to quote new vehicles if certain conditions are met.

## New Vehicle Quoting: Widget

To quote a new vehicle in our [widget](Widget), the following criteria will need to be adhered to. A `vrm` must be set to the value "NEW". Since there is no VRM for us to do a lookup on,
you must provide your own `capId`, as this will identify the vehicle so that a quote can be generated. Similarly, since the vehicle won't have a registration date, the `registrationDate` needs to be set to today's date, rolling.

For example, if the date is 09/03/2021, then the `registrationDate` should also be 09/03/2021.

The `condition` needs to be set to new and the `currentOdometerReading` needs to be 0. The below example demonstrates the quoting of a new vehicle in the widget.

The iframe is being used here for demonstration. In your integration please ensure you are using the `<script>` tag

:::

```jsx live
function widget() {
  function todaysDate() {
    let date = new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleString("en-GB"); //Get Today's Date
    let dateFormat = date.split(","); // Format it
    let justDate = dateFormat[0]; // Return just the date portion of the string
    return justDate;
  }
  function buildUrl() {
    return (
      "https://newvehicle.com/widgets/lib/finance-comparator-beta/?username=www.ivendimotors.com&quoteeUid=268E8202-338E-4B26-A6FE-74BCDAB0A357&class=Car&condition=new&vrm=NEW&registrationDate=" +
      todaysDate() +
      "&capCode=&capId=96096&cashPrice=30000&vatIncluded=true&vatQualifying=false&currentOdometerReading=0&vehicleImageUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-psa.groupe-psa.com%2Fmedias%2Fdomain1%2Fmedia11848%2F2009228-r00lv2pybs-preview.jpg&cashDepositType=flatRate&cashDeposit=1000&term=48&annualDistance=10000&dateOnForecourt=" +
      todaysDate() +
      "&usePersistedOptions=false&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fsales-widget-demo.ivendi.co%2F&widgetId=iv-finance-widget"
    );
  }

  return (
    <>
      <iframe
        width={770 + "px"}
        height={1000 + "px"}
        src={buildUrl()}
        id="iv-finance-widget"
        name="iv-finance-widget"
      ></iframe>
    </>
  );
}
```

## New Vehicle Quoting: Quoteware

Since the widget relies on Quoteware to generate its quotes, it is therefore possible to use new vehicles with Quoteware. Similar to the above, the matching fields in the request asset object need to be filled out as below.



```json title="application/json"
...
"Asset": {
				"CurrentOdometerReading": 0,
				"RegistrationDate": todaysDate(),
				"RegistrationMark": "NEW",
				"Condition": "new",
				"Source": "Default",
				"Identity": "96096", // This is the capId
				"IdentityType": "RVC", //RVC tells quoteware we're using the capId to identify the vehicle
				"StockIdentity": "",
				"StockingDate": null,
				"StockLocation": null,
				"Class": "Car",
				"CubicCentimetres": 0,
				"EntityType": "None"
			},
...
```

## New Vehicle Quoting: Payment Search

Since payment search is a subset of Quoteware, you can also use this for new vehicles. Similarly to the widget and Quoteware, there are fields that need to be set specifically for new vehicles.
`Identifier` needs to be set to the capId of the vehicle along with `IdentifierType` being set to RVC. The `IsNew` flag needs to be set to true. As with the above the `RegistrationNumber` should be set to NEW and the `CurrentMileage` should be 0.
The `RegistrationDate` should also be today's date, rolling. See the below example Vehicle object extract of a [payment search](PaymentSearch) request for an example.

```json title="application/json"
...
Vehicle: {
            CashPrice: 30000, //The Cash Price of the Vehicle
            IsNew: true, //Set to true
            Identifier: "96096", //The CAP ID of the requested vehicle
            IdentifierType: "RVC", //Default to RVC, meaning that CAP data will be used to dictate the calculation.
            Type: "car", //The class of vehicle requested - (  Car  //  Motorbike  //  LCV  )
            StockId: null,
            RegistrationNumber: "NEW", //The Vehicle Registration Number.
            CurrentMileage: 0, //The Mileage of the Vehicle
            RegistrationDate: todaysDate(), //The current date, rolling
            ProductUid: null,
          },
...
```
