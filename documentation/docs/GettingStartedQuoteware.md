The iVendi Website Solutions - Finance Suite consists of several easy-to-integrate website widgets, which enables a customer to complete their vehicle finance journey online.

There are two main ways that you can use the qouteware
### Quoteware
Quoteware is the name of the engine that generates the quotes used in our products. It has multiple variable parameters that can be heavily customised to pull back different types of quotes depending on what you have specified in the request. 

The main endpoint generates all information needed to display a 'Full Quote' which is to say that it can be quite bloated. This is due to the fact it powers our [finance compartator widget](Widget).

### Payment Search
Payment search is a filter that can be applied to a selection of vehicles on a dealer website that allows the
user to narrow a choice of vehicles to those falling within a specific payment range.
The payment range itself is a product of the vehicle price; the vehicle itself; customer deposit; loan term;
anticipated annual mileage; recorded mileage, and the sellout rate at which the dealer has set for motor
finance products being quoted, notably Hire Purchase (HP), Conditional Sales (CS), Personal Contact
Purchase (PCP) and Lease Purchase (LP).

You can think of payment search as Quoteware Lite.
