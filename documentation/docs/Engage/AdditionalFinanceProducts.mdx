If you would like to offer additional product types that are supported, such as conditional sale, a flag can be passed into the Engage widget bootstrapper as follows:

```
var engage = new lib.Webshop({
  ...hasCsFinance: true,
});
```

This flag will enable the ‘CS’ finance button to appear within the budget section of your Engage widget filters. CS will also be included within the ‘ANY’ filter.
