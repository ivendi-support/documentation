There are three predefined values that can be passed to the Engage widget bootstrapper snippet during instantiation:

```
var engage = new lib.Webshop({
  ...predefinedDeposit: 2000, // number,
  predefinedSearch: ‘2013 polo match 1.4’ // string
  predefinedClass: ‘Car’ // One of ‘Car’, ‘Van’, ‘Bike’
});
```

The deposit is intended to be used in conjunction with your own site’s pre-search/homepage for cash-only part-ex/trade-in/regular cash deposit and can be updated during the customer journey within the Budget filter.

The search term is intended to be used in conjunction with your own site’s pre-search/homepage and will persist until changed by the user.

The class is to silently filter against a given vehicle class. Useful for a “See all cars” vs “See all vans” type functionality.

To clear any of these values, the widget will need to be re-instantiated and new/empty values passed.
